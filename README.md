Letterboxd is currently a website that is gaining popularity and is already beginning to surpass major players such as IMDB. It is not just a site for rating movies, but a kind of social network that allows users to share news about movies they have watched, etc.
The website contains information about films, namely the title, director, year of release, genre, etc. It is this information that our project collects.
